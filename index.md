## Our mission

BCU Labs seeks to draw insight and tell stories from the wealth of biking data in Boston.  Our mission is to leverage the power of data through creative experimentation, learn where Boston can improve its infrastructure, whether physical or digital, and continue to empower BCU's advocacy one pedal at a time.  Through our framework of mobility justice and equity, we strive to push for positive change in our micromobility networks, neighborhoods, and mindsets for everybody, no matter who you are or where you ride.
