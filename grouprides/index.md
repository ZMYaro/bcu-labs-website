<h1>Tips For Group Rides</h1>

From weekly Boston Café Bikers outings, to monthly Critical Mass rides, to annual events like Boss Babes on Bikes, Boston By Bike...At Night, and the Halloween Bike Ride, Boston has no shortage of fun group rides.  Whether you are looking to join one or plan your own, here are some tips to keep things safe and fun:

## 5 Things To Remember For Group Rides

### 1. Stay behind the leader(s)

They are the authority on when and where the group stops, rolls, and turns.


### 2. Move as a unit & close gaps

For the safety of everyone in it, the group moves as one mass—just like you wouldn't expect the front half of a Green Line tram to leave the back half behind.  If there is a gap ahead of you, ride up and fill it!


### 3. Echo signals and calls

When the group is large or traffic is loud, it can be difficult for everyone to hear the leader(s).  Help them out by echoing calls all the way back and copying their hand signals!


### 4. Follow directions from marshals

Marshals are responsible for keeping the group safe.  If there is an issue like a conflict with a driver, a mechanical problem, or the group is going too fast for some riders, ask a marshal!

### 5. Leave a little space on the left

Marshals (especially corkers) may need to zoom from the back of the ride to the front.  Leave space on the left side of the group for them to pass!

## 5 Tips For _Planning_ Group Rides

### 1. Test-ride your route ahead of time

Maps can only get you so far.  Keep an eye out for complex intersections, construction, and traffic patterns for the group ride's time of day.


### 2. Consider conflicts

Who else uses the corridor you want to ride on at that time?  Are you going to inadvertently block a popular bus route during commuting hours or off-street path on a weekend afternoon?


### 3. Have a suitable team for the group

If you have a very small group, you may be able to ride with just a leader and a sweep.  If you expect to lead a mass of hundreds of riders or go through complex intersections, ensure you have enough marshals working with you to keep everything safe.  Ensure all marshals

### 5. Make it fun!

A group ride has all sorts of opportunities for fun stops that hit best on a cycle ride.  Take advantage of them!  A big plaza where everyone rides in a big swirl, a zoom through an echoey tunnel, a stop for a beautiful view at the top of a tall climb, or a nighttime dance party break in an empty park have all been fun choices.

## Glossary

### Corker

A **cork** or **corker** is a marshal who is corking or is assigned to cork intersections for a particular ride.

### Corking

To **cork** or **corking** is when marshals block entrances to an intersection while the group passes through, kind of like human railroad crossing gates.  To avoid leaving anyone behind, the group will continue moving through an intersection even if the traffic light turns red after they have already started crossing.  Corkers will communicate that to others trying to enter the intersection and thank them for their patience, and will stay in place until the sweep reaches them.

### Sweep

The **sweep** is the marshal behind the last rider in the group.  If someone stops unexpectedly, the sweep usually stays to help them reconnect unless they confirm they are leaving the group.
